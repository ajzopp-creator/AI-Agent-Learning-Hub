Six months ago, "graph engineering" wasn't a job title anyone used. Today it's one of the fastest-moving specializations in applied AI, and almost nobody currently working in it has more than a few months of hands-on experience, because the field itself is that new.

That's actually the opportunity. Most specializations you'd try to break into have a decade of accumulated expertise you're competing against. This one doesn't. The people who are genuinely good at it right now learned it in the last six months, from the same public sources you can access starting today. Zero prior experience isn't a disadvantage here the way it would be in a mature field. It's the actual starting condition almost everyone in this space shares.

This is the complete course, zero to genuinely employable, grounded entirely in real, publicly available material, not speculation about what might work.

## What A Graph Architect Actually Does

Before the curriculum, it's worth being precise about the actual job, because "graph architect" gets used loosely and the real work is more specific than the title suggests.

A graph architect builds the structure that lets AI agents remember, connect, and reason across information that would otherwise disappear the moment a context window closes. Two distinct but related skill sets fall under this title right now.

**Knowledge graph construction.** Taking unstructured information, documents, transcripts, support tickets, whatever a business actually has sitting around, and building a structured graph of entities and relationships out of it, so an AI system can query real connections instead of just retrieving similar-sounding text chunks.

**Agentic graph design.** Structuring how an agent's actual decision-making runs, using an explicit graph of states and transitions instead of an opaque loop where the model decides what happens next invisibly, inside its own reasoning, with no external record of why.

These aren't competing definitions of the role, they're two halves of the same underlying skill, using graph structure to make something explicit and inspectable that would otherwise be hidden inside a model's black-box reasoning. A genuinely strong graph architect can do both.

## Why Zero Experience Genuinely Works Here

This deserves a direct answer rather than a motivational aside, because it's the actual reason this specific course makes sense right now.

The foundational public resources in this space are recent, comprehensive, and free. Anthropic published an official cookbook on knowledge graph construction using Claude directly, covering the real extraction-to-query pipeline. Neo4j's own Innovation Lead built a full course on agentic knowledge graph construction, publicly available on [DeepLearning.AI](https://deeplearning.ai/). The theoretical framework for agentic graph design, immutable plans, separated layers, strict escalation, came out of a real, published arXiv paper in April 2026.

None of this requires a computer science degree to access or understand. It requires the ability to read carefully, build small working examples, and iterate. That's genuinely the entire prerequisite.

## Phase One: Foundations, Weeks One And Two

Understanding Why Graphs Beat Plain Retrieval

Start here, because everything else in this course builds on understanding this specific gap.

A standard retrieval system, the kind most people mean when they say "RAG," finds documents similar to your question and hands them to a model. Ask it "which supplier caused a specific product's returns" and it gives you relevant chunks of text, not the actual causal chain proving the answer, support ticket, defective part, product line, supplier, shipment batch, root cause.

A knowledge graph represents that chain directly, as connected entities and relationships, so an agent can traverse the actual connections instead of guessing from text similarity. This is the single concept that justifies the entire field, and if you don't yet feel the difference between "finding a relevant document" and "following a real chain of connected facts," spend real time here before moving forward. Everything downstream depends on genuinely understanding this distinction, not just being able to repeat it.

Your First Hands-On Exercise

Pick any small, real body of text you have access to, a set of product reviews, a handful of support tickets, even a Wikipedia article about something you know well. Manually identify the entities, people, products, organizations, events, and manually draw the relationships between them on paper or in a simple diagram tool.

This exercise feels almost too simple, and that's exactly the point. Before you build anything with a model doing this extraction automatically, you need to understand what correct entity and relationship extraction actually looks like when you do it yourself. This is the same discipline a good engineer applies to any automation: understand the manual process deeply before automating it, so you can actually tell when the automated version is getting it wrong.

## Phase Two: The Real Extraction Pipeline, Weeks Three And Four

This is where you move from understanding the concept to building the actual mechanism, grounded directly in Anthropic's own published approach.

The Four-Stage Pipeline

**Extract.** A fast, cheap model call pulls entities and subject-predicate-object triples from a single document. One call per document, using a structured schema so the output is consistent and parseable rather than freeform text you have to interpret.

**Resolve.** This is the step most beginners underestimate. Real-world text refers to the same entity in different ways, "Edwin Aldrin" and "Buzz Aldrin" with zero string overlap, and a naive system treats them as two different people. Resolution uses a model to cluster these variants correctly using context and description, not simple string matching, which is exactly the kind of task that requires real semantic understanding rather than a lookup table.

**Assemble.** Canonical nodes and typed edges get built into one connected graph, with provenance tracked on every single triple, meaning you can always trace a specific fact back to the specific source document it came from. This matters enormously for trustworthiness, an agent that can cite exactly where a claim came from is fundamentally more reliable than one that can't.

**Query.** A relevant subgraph gets serialized and handed to a model, which reasons over the actual triples rather than raw text, with every answer citing a specific edge in the graph rather than a vague reference to "the documents."

Building Your First Real Pipeline

Practice prompt for the Extract stage, adaptable to any document set you're working with: "Extract all entities and subject-predicate-object triples from this document. Use this schema: entities need a type (person, organization, product, event, location) and a canonical name field. Triples need a subject, predicate, and object, each referencing an entity by its canonical name. Output as structured JSON. Do not invent relationships not actually stated or clearly implied in the text."

Practice prompt for the Resolve stage: "Here are entities extracted from multiple documents: \[paste your extracted entity list\]. Identify which entities likely refer to the same real-world thing despite different surface names. For each cluster you identify, explain what specific context led you to that conclusion, not just that the names seem similar."

Run this pipeline manually, stage by stage, against a real small document set of your own choosing before automating the full sequence. Check the Extract output against your own manual reading of the source. Check the Resolve output specifically for both false merges, treating two different entities as the same, and missed merges, failing to connect two references that are actually the same entity. Both error types matter, and beginners consistently catch the first while missing the second.

## Phase Three: Agentic Graph Design, Weeks Five And Six

With the knowledge-graph-construction half of the skill set underway, this phase covers the second half, using graphs to structure how an agent's own decision-making runs.

The Core Problem This Solves

A standard agent loop hides one specific decision inside an opaque model call: what happens next. When an agent decides to retry a failed step, that decision lives entirely inside the model's reasoning, invisible before it happens, unauditable after. For low-stakes work, this doesn't matter much. For genuinely consequential, long-running agentic work, it becomes the actual point of failure.

The Three Commitments

A graph-structured agent system, based on the real, published framework, rests on three specific commitments worth understanding deeply, not just memorizing.

**Immutable plan.** The execution plan locks once generated and doesn't shift mid-run based on the model's own improvisation. This trades real flexibility for real auditability, a deliberate bet, not a strict improvement in every situation.

**Separated layers.** Planning, execution, and recovery happen as genuinely independent roles, not blended into one continuous reasoning process, mirroring the same principle behind never letting an agent grade its own work.

**Strict escalation.** Recovery from a failure follows a fixed, predefined protocol with a real limit, rather than retrying indefinitely and hoping something eventually works.

Your Second Hands-On Exercise

Take a real, multi-step task you'd normally hand to an agent as a single loose prompt, migrating a small piece of code, researching a specific question across several sources, anything with genuine multiple steps. Instead, explicitly design it as a graph. Write down the actual states: Planning, Executing Step One, Executing Step Two, Recovering, Escalated, Complete. Write down the actual transition rules between them, what specifically triggers moving from one state to the next.

Run this task through an agent using your explicit graph structure, giving it the states and transition rules directly as instructions rather than a loose, single prompt. Compare the result against running the same task as a normal, unstructured loop. The difference you're looking for isn't necessarily better output, it's whether you can actually explain, after the fact, exactly why the system did what it did at each step. That explainability is the entire value proposition of this half of the skill set.

## Phase Four: Building A Real Portfolio Project, Weeks Seven Through Ten

This phase is what actually makes you employable, not the theory alone. A portfolio project demonstrating both halves of this skill set, working, not hypothetical, is worth more than any credential in a field this new.

Choosing The Right Project

The project that demonstrates real competence combines both halves of the course: a knowledge graph built from a real, messy body of text, queried by an agent structured with explicit graph-based decision logic, not an opaque loop.

A strong, achievable scope for a first project: pick a domain with genuinely interesting relationship structure, customer support tickets connected to products and root causes, a company's internal documentation connected across departments, even a personal knowledge base built from your own notes and reading. Build the four-stage extraction pipeline against a real, meaningfully sized document set, not a toy example of five sentences. Then build an agent that queries this graph using explicit, graph-structured decision logic for how it handles ambiguous questions, missing information, and genuinely uncertain answers, rather than a loose loop that might handle these cases well or might not.

What Makes A Project Actually Demonstrate Competence

The difference between a portfolio project that gets you hired and one that doesn't isn't complexity, it's honesty about what actually works and what doesn't.

Document the failure modes you found, not just the successes. A resolution step that incorrectly merged two different people because they had similar names in a specific context. A query that returned a confidently wrong answer because the graph had a gap in coverage. These aren't embarrassing details to hide, they're the actual evidence that you understand the system deeply enough to know where it breaks, which is exactly what separates someone who copied a tutorial from someone who genuinely built and stress-tested something real.

Include your actual prompts and schema definitions in whatever you share publicly, not just a description of what the project does. Anyone evaluating you for this kind of role wants to see the actual extraction schema, the actual resolution logic, the actual graph structure you designed, because that's the real skill being evaluated, not the polished demo.

## Where To Actually Learn Each Piece

Pulling together the real, verified resources this course draws from, in the order that matches the phases above.

For the conceptual foundation and the extraction pipeline specifically, Anthropic's own Claude Cookbook has a published, official guide on knowledge graph construction covering exactly the Extract, Resolve, Assemble, Query pipeline described in Phase Two, free and public.

For a full, structured curriculum covering agentic knowledge graph construction end to end, including multi-agent systems built on top of a graph, [DeepLearning.AI](https://deeplearning.ai/) hosts a complete course taught by Andreas Kollegger, Neo4j's Innovation Lead, free to audit.

For the theoretical grounding on agentic graph design specifically, the three commitments and the five-move structure from Phase Three trace back to a real, published April 2026 arXiv paper, worth reading directly rather than only through secondhand summaries, since the paper's own honest caveats about what remains unproven in practice are part of what makes it worth taking seriously rather than treating as settled fact.

## A Full Worked Example: From Zero To A Working System

To make the ten-week structure concrete rather than abstract, here's how it actually plays out on a real, specific project, a knowledge graph built from customer support tickets for a fictional but realistic small software product.

Weeks one and two, you manually read through twenty real or realistic support tickets and draw out the entities and relationships by hand. Customer, product feature, bug type, resolution, support agent. You notice something you wouldn't have predicted going in, several tickets reference the same underlying bug using completely different language, "the app crashes when I upload a photo" and "getting an error on image attachments" are the same root cause described two different ways. This observation becomes directly useful later, it's exactly the pattern entity resolution needs to catch.

Weeks three and four, you build the actual four-stage pipeline against a larger set, a few hundred tickets. The Extract stage pulls entities and triples from each ticket individually. The Resolve stage, tested carefully against the pattern you noticed manually in weeks one and two, correctly clusters the differently-worded bug reports into single canonical bug entities. You find, testing this, that your first resolution prompt was too aggressive, it merged two genuinely different bugs that happened to share some surface vocabulary. You tighten the prompt, adding an instruction to require stronger contextual evidence before merging, and rerun the test set to confirm the fix actually worked rather than just assuming it did.

Weeks five and six, you design the agentic side, an agent meant to answer questions like "which recent bugs are affecting the most customers" by querying your new graph. You explicitly structure its decision logic as a graph rather than a loose loop, a Planning state that decides which part of the graph is relevant to the question, a Query state that retrieves and reasons over the relevant subgraph, a Recovery state for when the initial query returns insufficient information, with a strict limit of two retry attempts before escalating the question back to you rather than guessing.

Weeks seven through ten, you formalize this into an actual shareable portfolio project. You write up not just what it does, but the specific resolution error you caught and fixed in week four, and the specific reason you set the retry limit at two rather than some other number in week six. This documentation, the honest account of what broke and how you actually fixed it, is what turns a working demo into evidence of real understanding.

Notice that nothing in this walkthrough required exotic tooling or an unusual dataset. It required following the structure of the course seriously, catching your own mistakes honestly, and documenting the actual reasoning behind your decisions rather than only the polished final result.

## The Real Job Market For This Right Now

Worth being direct about what actually hiring for this looks like today, since a course promising a specific outcome without addressing this honestly isn't giving you the full picture.

This specific title, "graph architect," is not yet a standardized job posting most companies are actively searching for by that exact name. What you're actually building toward is a specific, demonstrable skill set that shows up inside broader roles, AI engineer, applied ML engineer, agent systems engineer, where knowledge graph construction and agentic system design are increasingly a differentiating skill within the application, not the literal job title on the posting.

The practical implication: don't wait for a job posting that says "graph architect" before applying anywhere. Look for AI engineering and agent-focused roles generally, and lead with your portfolio project specifically when you apply, since this is exactly the kind of concrete, verifiable evidence that separates a candidate who can talk about agentic systems abstractly from one who has actually built and debugged a real pipeline.

Freelance and contract work is currently a realistic, faster path into this than a full-time role for many people starting from zero, precisely because the field is new enough that companies experimenting with their first knowledge graph or agentic system often want a focused, contained engagement before committing to a full hire. A well-documented portfolio project is exactly the credibility signal that makes a cold outreach message land, here's a real system I built, here's what broke, here's how I fixed it, would this be useful for what you're working on.

## Common Mistakes That Slow People Down

A handful of specific mistakes show up repeatedly among people learning this from scratch, worth knowing in advance.

**Skipping the manual exercise in Phase One.** Jumping straight to automated extraction without first understanding what correct extraction looks like by doing it yourself produces someone who can run a pipeline but can't actually evaluate whether its output is any good.

**Treating entity resolution as a solved, boring step.** This is consistently where beginner projects have the most hidden errors, both false merges and missed merges, and it's exactly the step most tutorials rush through because it's less visually interesting than the final graph.

**Building the knowledge graph half without ever touching the agentic design half, or vice versa.** The people who are genuinely strong in this field right now can do both, because they're two applications of the same underlying idea, using explicit structure to replace opaque, hidden decision-making. Specializing too early, before you've built competence in both, limits how deeply you actually understand the underlying principle.

**Optimizing a portfolio project for visual polish over honest documentation of what actually works and what doesn't.** A beautiful graph visualization with no discussion of failure modes signals someone who ran a tutorial once. A rougher-looking project with a genuine, specific account of what broke and how it got fixed signals someone who actually built and understood a real system.

## Building The Habit That Actually Compounds

The specific technical steps above matter, but the single habit that determines whether someone genuinely reaches competence versus stalls out partway through is less about technique and more about discipline, worth naming directly since it's the part most courses skip.

Keep a running log of every extraction error, resolution mistake, and query failure you encounter, from week one through week ten and beyond. Not a vague memory of "the resolution step had some issues," a specific, dated entry, what the input was, what went wrong, what you changed, whether the fix actually held up when you tested it again. This log becomes, over a few months, the single most valuable asset you have, more valuable than any finished project, because it's the actual record of your own judgment improving over real, specific cases rather than abstract principle.

This mirrors exactly the same discipline recommended for anyone building production agentic systems generally, write down what was learned, consolidate it periodically into the lessons that actually generalize, recall the relevant ones before starting related work. Applying that same discipline to your own learning process, not just to the systems you build, is what separates someone who worked through this course once from someone who's still getting measurably better six months later.

Revisit your week four resolution errors after you've built the week six agentic layer. You'll very likely notice patterns you missed the first time, now that you understand the fuller system those errors eventually feed into. This kind of deliberate revisiting, not just moving forward through new material, is where a lot of the real depth in this field actually gets built, and it costs nothing beyond the discipline to actually do it consistently.

## What Happens After The Ten Weeks

By the end of this course, you have two real, demonstrated capabilities: building a genuine knowledge graph extraction pipeline from messy real-world text, and structuring an agent's own decision-making as an explicit, auditable graph rather than an opaque loop. Both grounded in real, current, verifiable public material, not a fabricated shortcut or a course promising more than the underlying technology actually delivers yet.

The honest next step from here is depth, not breadth. Pick one domain, one real, ongoing project, and keep building against it past the initial ten weeks. The field is moving fast enough that six more months of genuinely hands-on work against a real project will put you meaningfully ahead of almost everyone still working through introductory material, precisely because the field itself has so little accumulated depth yet that sustained, honest practice compounds unusually fast right now.

That's the actual opportunity in a specialization this new. Not that it's easy, the work in this course is genuinely substantive, but that the distance between zero experience and genuine competence is shorter here than in almost any other technical specialization currently hiring, because nobody has had the decade of head start that would normally separate a beginner from an expert.
